### *\#2: Self-lensing flares from black hole binaries. V: methods for systematic searches in LSST*  
**Kevin Park**, Zoltan Haiman, Chengcheng Xin, et al.

As the most recent paper in this series, we generated mock quasar light curves and injected periodic self-lensing flares. We found that standard Lomb-Scargle Periodograms were ineffective in recovering periodicity and that Matched Filters were able to recover injected binary parameters under idealized conditions.

### *\#1: Self-lensing flares from black hole binaries. IV. The number of detectable shadows (2025)*  
**Kevin Park**, Chengcheng Xin, Jordy Davelaar, Zoltan Haiman

Following up on a series of three papers which simulate self-lensing flares and dips (caused by the black hole shadow) in supermassive black hole binaries with general relativistic ray-tracing methods, I calculated the detection rates of flares and dips in LSST. The paper was published in [Physical Review D](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.111.063011) and can also be found on [NASA ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025PhRvD.111f3011P/abstract)
