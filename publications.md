### *Self-lensing flares from black hole binaries. IV. The number of detectable shadows*  
**Kevin Park**, Chengcheng Xin, Jordy Davelaar, Zoltan Haiman

Following up on a series of three papers which simulate self-lensing flares and dips (caused by the black hole shadow) in supermassive black hole binaries with general relativistic ray-tracing methods, I calculated the detection rates of flares and dips in LSST. The paper was published in [Physical Review D]([https://doi.org/10.1234/hypatia.arith.0400](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.111.063011)) and can also be found on [NASA ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025PhRvD.111f3011P/abstract)
