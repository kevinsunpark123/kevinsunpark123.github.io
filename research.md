# Previous Research

I study the transient signatures (self-lensing flares) of **supermassive black hole binaries** (SMBHBs). See detailed descriptions and outputs of my previous research [here](/publications/).


## Current Projects
- As a rotation project, I am currently working with Ilaria Caiazzo using the population synthesis code [COSMIC](https://github.com/COSMIC-PopSynth/COSMIC) to constrain the progenitors of some recently discovered rapidly-rotating, highly-magnetic white dwarfs.
