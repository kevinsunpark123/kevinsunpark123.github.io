## Current Projects
- I am also working with [Ilaria Caiazzo](https://ista.ac.at/en/research/caiazzo-group/) using the population synthesis code [COSMIC](https://github.com/COSMIC-PopSynth/COSMIC) to constrain the progenitors of double white dwarf binaries.

## Detection Methods of Self-Lensing Flares in Supermassive Black Hole Binaries

As the most recent paper in this series, we generated mock supermassive black hole binary light curves at realistic observation times injected periodic accretion variability, relativistic Doppler Boost, self-lensing flares, and quasar noise. We develop a computationally cheap three-step matched filter procedure to recover injected binary parameters from noise and sparse sampling.

## Detection Rates of Black Hole Shadows and Self-Lensing Flares in Supermassive Black Hole Binaries in LSST

Following up on a series of three papers which simulate self-lensing flares and dips (caused by the black hole shadow) in supermassive black hole binaries with general relativistic ray-tracing methods, I calculated the detection rates of flares and dips in LSST. The paper was published in [Physical Review D](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.111.063011) and can also be found on [NASA ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025PhRvD.111f3011P/abstract)
