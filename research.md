As the most recent paper in this series, we generated mock quasar light curves at realistic observation times and injected periodic self-lensing flares. We investigate methods to recover the injected periodic flares and binary parameters. 

## Detection Rates of Black Hole Shadows and Self-Lensing Flares in Supermassive Black Hole Binaries in LSST

Following up on a series of three papers which simulate self-lensing flares and dips (caused by the black hole shadow) in supermassive black hole binaries with general relativistic ray-tracing methods, I calculated the detection rates of flares and dips in LSST. The paper was published in [Physical Review D](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.111.063011) and can also be found on [NASA ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025PhRvD.111f3011P/abstract)

## Current Projects
- I am currently working with [Ilaria Caiazzo](https://ista.ac.at/en/research/caiazzo-group/) using the population synthesis code [COSMIC](https://github.com/COSMIC-PopSynth/COSMIC) to constrain the progenitors of double white dwarf binaries.
